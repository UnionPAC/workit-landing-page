### What I learned

In this project I learned how to create curved background images. They look super cool and give a dynamic feel to your website, which can really bring it to life. I have used sites like [Haikei](https://haikei.app/) before to create waves/ blobs, but have usually used it also the whole background. Whereas in this challenge I have two seperate wavy backgrounds (the dark and light purple) which are positioned differently and somewhat stacked.

I found a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkgKIOTgvCI&list=PLHK07DoqLi18cCOWp-PpIhSvozWtTF5vs&index=3) which showed me a site for creating for helping me create wavy shapes to add to my CSS.

To see how I did this, check the code snippet below:

```css
.dark-purple-curve {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  line-height: 0;
}

.dark-purple-curve svg {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: calc(283% + 1.3px);
  height: 72px;
}

.dark-purple-curve .shape-fill {
  fill: $dark-purple;
}

.light-purple-curve {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  line-height: 0;
}

.light-purple-curve svg {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: calc(283% + 1.3px);
  height: 72px;
}

.light-purple-curve .shape-fill {
  fill: $ghost-white;
}
```
